        <h2>Niagara Falls</h2>
        <div class="custom-grid" >
          <p class="slide-in from-left text-justify" >
            Niagara Falls are three massive waterfalls that form the border
            between Canada and the United States. The falls are located on the
            Niagara River between Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. The falls were
            formed at the end of the last ice age when the water from the Great
            Lakes broke through the Niagara Escarpment on the way to the
            Atlantic Ocean. The falls are a hugely popular tourist destination
            and have attracted honeymooners, families, and daredevils of all
            kinds, from those who went down the falls in a barrel to those who
            stretched a wire over the falls and walked across it. The falls have
            inspired hundreds of artists to create wonderful art and are still
            inspiring the millions of people who come to admire the majesty of
            nature as well as its power and its magnificent beauty.

        <h2>Apenzell, Switzerland</h2>
        <div class="custom-grid">
          <p class="slide-in from-left text-justify">
            Apenzell is the most traditional of all the Swiss regions, a rural
            world where time has stopped, where culture and tradition are
            celebrated, and where the charming landscape of rolling green hills
            full of plump cows is guarded by the 8,200-foot Mount Säntis. The
            village of Apenzell is the Switzerland of our imagination and in the
            fairytales of our childhood, with its lavishly carved chalets,
            carriages drawn by horses in full feathered headdresses, a busy
            village square where all the village business is conducted, richly
            painted emblems and panels on all of Appenzell’s buildings, and
            gnomes competing for space with flower boxes dripping with vivid red
            geraniums. There is always a festival going on, or a concert,
            wedding, or celebration in which everyone participates, and there
            are seemingly endless hiking trails that turn into magical
            cross-country trails when the winter throws its white blanket over
            everything

        <h2>Bora Bora, French Polynesia</h2>
        <div class="custom-grid">
          <p class="slide-in from-left text-justify">
            Far, far away in the vast South Pacific lies a dreamlike island with
            a dormant volcano at its heart, covered by thick jungle, surrounded
            by an emerald necklace of tiny sand-fringed islands that form a
            turquoise lagoon hiding rich coral reefs and thousands of colorful
            fish. As you spot this magical place while landing in a small plane
            from nearby Tahiti, you become aware that you are reaching one of
            the most beautiful islands in the world, where luxury resorts
            compete with lavish nature to fulfill your every wish.

        <h2>Fiordland National Park, New Zealand</h2>
        <div class="custom-grid">
          <p class="slide-in from-left text-justify">
            The fjords could be the product of relentless carving by glaciers
            over some 100,000 years, which the sea then filled as far as it
            could reach. On all sides, these canyon-like fjords are covered by
            waterfalls that tumble endlessly and thunderously, taking huge
            quantities of rainwater towards the sea. Huge granite mountains are
            dotted with emerald lakes, dense rainforests, and animals that do
            not exist anywhere else. Walking through Fiordland, it is easy to
            imagine the world as it looked thousands of years ago.
